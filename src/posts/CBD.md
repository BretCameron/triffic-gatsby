There’s no doubt about it: CBD oil is the next Big Thing in health and wellness. In the hipster coffee houses of major cities, adding CBD to your morning latte is as commonplace as adding a splash of milk. The actress Kristen Bell apparently uses it to ease her muscles after a workout. It comes in lotions, drinks, vapours, gummy bears — even dog biscuits — and for many people it’s becoming a staple part of their routine for treating insomnia or anxiety. It’s poised to take the wellness industry by storm, and it looks like this is the only the beginning, with the industry expected to grow exponentially over the next few years.

Ever since the 2018 Farm Law was passed, legalising the industrial production of hemp, CBD businesses have been cropping up everywhere. Some consumers are coming into the industry blind, lured in by false promises that CBD is a cure-all, a miracle fix for everything from acne to cancer. How much of it is marketing, and how much of it is science?

### Cause for Scepticism

As with any product branded as a medical miracle, there’s reason for doubt about the lofty claims some have made about CBD. There is significant enough evidence to suggest that CBD shows a lot of medical promise. However, as it exists now, this is a highly unregulated market, and consumers need to proceed with caution.

The current combination of limited regulations, a wave of new startups and ignorant consumers is a recipe for misinformation. The industry is vulnerable to the sale of fake oils marketing themselves as CBD. There are already several horror stories to corroborate this. In 2017, 52 people in Utah experienced seizures, hallucinations, and loss of consciousness, after ingesting a product branding itself as CBD oil.

If you are thinking of purchasing CBD online, it’s important that you understand the facts: first, what science currently knows about CBD, and second, what differentiates the real thing from the fakes.

### What is CBD and what does it actually do?

CBD (or cannabidiol) is one of over 110 cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant. Unlike its more famous sibling, THC (the compound in cannabis that causes a high), CBD is non-psychoactive. It does, however, appear to have anti-inflammatory properties and it’s been shown to alleviate anxiety, psychosis and movement disorders. It also seems that CBD has a remarkable effect on relieving seizures. For instance, Epidiolex, a prescription medication containing CBD, has been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of epilepsy.

### What don’t we know?

Even though CBD has been shown to reduce seizures, scientist aren’t yet certain why it works that way. A lot of the research around what CBD actually does to our bodies and brains is still at an early stage, so be wary of CBD brands spouting biological terms to explain how CBD rearranges your chakra — there’s a high chance they have no idea what they’re talking about.

It also seems that CBD may be effective as a form of pain relief for conditions like migraines, fibromyalgia, and period pain. However, many of the studies on pain relief have been conducted on animals, not humans. It’s hard to deduce whether the pain relief people speak about anecdotally is something concrete or if it’s simply part of a placebo effect.

Lastly, there are question marks around dosage. 10mg is the dosage you’ll see recommended the most, and yet some scientists think this is too small to have any effect.

### Real or fake: how can you tell?

A study published in 2017 found that less than a third of CBD oils contained the amount of CBD they claimed to on the label; in fact, many had no CBD in them at all.

Here are three ways to determine whether the CBD oil you’re buying might be fake. When researching a company, always ask yourself the following questions:

#### 1. Do they know where it comes from?

You wouldn’t accept a sandwich from someone if they gave you shifty eyes when you asked where it was from. It’s worth asking your seller where they source their CBD from, and how it’s manufactured. If it seems like they have no conception of the manufacturing process, then you can’t be expected to trust them on the quality of their product.

#### 2. Who are their partners?

If you’re purchasing from someone who’s importing their products from another company, then find out who their partners are. Their manufacturers should be working with a license, as this means they’ll be working under MHRA (Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) or FDA guidance.

#### 3. Third party lab results

CBD brands should be able to give you access to their lab results. Testing the potency and quality of its CBD in a lab is the only way a brand can prove their legitimacy. If a brand can’t provide any lab results, then it’s possible they’ve failed their lab tests, or it may suggest that they’re not concerned for the quality or safety of their product.

### **Conclusion**

In an unregulated market, consumers have a responsibility to protect themselves. Currently, the marketing outweighs the science. While consumer access to CBD has skyrocketed, it’s still relatively difficult for scientists to study the compound. The FDA is now discussing new regulations around CBD products, but it could take some years before we better understand the science of CBD and can more easily guarantee the safety of a product.

In the meantime, always carry out a lot of research your brand of choice before you buy from them, and always talk to your doctor before taking CBD.

And when in doubt, apply this rule: if it’s very, very cheap, there’s probably a reason why.
